    "The watershed algorithm transformation treats the image it operates upon like a topographic map, with the brightness of each point representing its height, and finds the lines that run along the tops of ridges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any grayscale image can be viewed as a topographic surface where high intensity denotes peaks and hills while low intensity denotes valleys. The algorithm can then fill every isolated valley (local minima) with different coloured water (labels). We're colouring the different segments of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the \"water\" rises, depending on the peaks (gradients) nearby, \"water\" from different valleys (different segments of the image), with different colours could start to merge. To avoid this merging, the algorithm creates barriers (segment edge boundaries) in locations where \"water\" merges. A boundary will be created between segments of different brightness levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is especially useful for segmenting images into background and foreground in situations that are difficult for other algorithms. A common example is the use of coins next to each other on a table. In this case, it may be unclear to the algorithm if it should be treated as one large object or many small objects. The watershed algorithm segments out each coin individually as humans do. \n",
