    "## Boosting Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based off AdaBoost algorithm (the same underlying algorithm that the Haar cascade based face detector uses).\n",
    "* Evaluation occurs across multiple frames\n",
    "* Pros:\n",
    " * Very well known and studied algorithm\n",
    "* Cons:\n",
    " * Doesn't know when tracking has failed. It could keep tracking the face but if face disappers from video, it will still think it's tracking it.\n",

    "## Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "* An improvement to AdaBoost tracker\n",
    "* Similar to boosting but considers a neighbourhood of points around the current location to create multiple instances \n",
    "* Pros:\n",
    " * Good performance and doesn't drift as much as boosting\n",
    "* Cons:\n",
    " * Failure to track may not be reported back\n",
    " * Can't recover from full obstruction\n",

    "## Kernelized Correlation Filters (KCF) Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exploits some properties of the MIL Tracker and the fact that many data points will overlap, leading to more accurate and faster tracking\n",
    "* Pros:\n",
    " * Better than Boosting and MIL\n",
    " * Great first choice\n",
    "* Cons:\n",
    " * Can not recover from the full obstruction of the object (and if object is moving too fast)\n",

    "## Tracking, Learning and Detection (TLD) Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "* The tracker follows the object from frame to frame\n",
    "* The detector localizes all appearances that have been observed so far and corrects the tracker if necessary\n",
    "* The learning estimates detector's errors and updates it to avoid these errors in the future\n",
    "* Pros:\n",
    " * Good at tracking even with obstruction in frames\n",
    " * Tracks well under large changes in scale (TLD can deal with e.g. car moving fast towards the camera)\n",
    "* Cons:\n",
    " * Can provide many false positives (TLD can switch into tracking object which is not the one of interest)\n",

    "## MedianFlow Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "* Internally, this tracker tracks the object in both forward and backward directions in time and measures the discrepancies between these two trajectories\n",
    "* Pros:\n",
    " * Very good at reporting failed tracking (reports immediately if object is not in the frame anymore)\n",
    " * Works well with predictable motion (e.g. races...when object's trajectory is predictable)\n",
    "* Cons:\n",
    " * Fails under large motion (fast moving objects)\n",
