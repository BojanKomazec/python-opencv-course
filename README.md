These are my course notes and comments. I do not own syllabus, material or resources in this repository.


## Useful JupyterLab keyboard shortcuts

SHIFT + TAB = open Python documentation about function (when mouse hovers the function)
SHIFT + ENTER = execute current cell (`[*]` next to cell means that it is currently executing)

## Troubleshooting

If for some reason cell remains indefinitely in executing state (`[*]`) we need to restart the kernel.
